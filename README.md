👋 Hi, I’m @AlonsoSG0

👀 I’m interested in web development and artificial intelligence. I'm passionate about creating innovative and efficient applications.

🌱 I’m currently learning about AWS and application deployment in the cloud. I'm also experimenting with Astro and exploring new ways to build for the web.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on application development projects, especially those involving technologies like React, Next.js, Node.js, and Express.js. I'm also open to projects that explore the potential of AI.

📫 You can reach me by email: alosangue00@gmail.com

⚡ Fun fact: I enjoy reading, experimenting with new technologies, and building with AI.
